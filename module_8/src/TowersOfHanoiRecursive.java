/**
 * Algo for recursive solution for Towers of Hanoi
 *
 * 1. Base case: if numberOfDisks == 1, move disk from source to destination
 * 2. To solve the problem for n, recursively solve the problem of moving disk n-1 disks from source to spare
 * 3. Then, Move disk n from source to destination
 * 4. Recursively solve the problem of moving disks from spare to destination
 *
 * Generally, it makes sense that we need to move n âˆ’ 1 discs onto the spare peg, using the destination peg as the spare poll
 * (we do this by switching the pole arguments in the recursive call). After that, the remaining nth disc will be moved
 * to the destination peg and afterwards the second recursion call completes the moving of the rest of the disks, by moving
 * the disks on the spare tower fto the destination peg, above the nth disk.
