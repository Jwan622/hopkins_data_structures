on 18:22 of the complexity module video, g(x) is an estimate of f(x). 18:34 says it best where g(x) is multiple by a different multiple so it can be a higher and lower bound of f(x). The same function g(x) by itself without a multiple cannot be a higher or lower bound of f(x).

-theta is when g(x) can serve as both an upper and lower bound of f(x). Of course, g(x) is multipled by a constant. If g(x) can be a upper and lower bound of f(x), g(x) is theta of f(x)

Big Omega is the lower bound
Big theta is when the estimate can be both upper and lower bound, with different constants.
